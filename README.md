# Portfolio — Senior Full Stack Developer

This is a simple static portfolio created with HTML and Tailwind CSS (via CDN). It uses a dark theme with coral/orange accents inspired by your reference image.

Files added / updated
- `index.html` — main page, responsive layout: hero, about, services, portfolio, resume preview, contact.
- `styles.css` — small custom tweaks (font helper, shadows).
- `profilepic.png` — your profile image (used in hero and portfolio placeholders).
- `vipul_jain_fsd.pdf` — your resume (embedded for preview and available for download).

Resume summary
- A short HTML resume summary has been added to the `Resume` section so visitors can quickly scan your headline, top skills and selected experience without opening the PDF. The full `vipul_jain_fsd.pdf` is still embedded and downloadable.

How to preview locally
1. Open `c:\Users\JAINV017\Documents\portfolio\index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with).
2. The resume is embedded under the "Resume" section — or click "Download Resume" to open the PDF separately.

What I changed to match your resume folder
- Swapped the placeholder avatar for `profilepic.png` found in the folder and used it across the UI.
- Added an embedded preview of `vipul_jain_fsd.pdf` and a download link.

Suggested next steps (I can do any of these):
- Extract resume key sections (headline, top skills, selected experience) and include them as HTML for SEO and accessibility.
- Wire the contact form to an email service (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or a serverless function.
- Replace each portfolio tile with actual project screenshots and per-project case study pages.
- Convert to a Tailwind build (npm + purge) for smaller CSS in production.
